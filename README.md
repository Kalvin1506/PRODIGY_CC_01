# PRODIGY_CC_01

Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation 🔐 This project is part of the Prodigy Labs Internship Program and serves as Task 1: implementing a basic encryption and decryption system using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

📌 Task Objective Build a Python program that:

Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

Accepts user input for the message and shift value.

Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Preserves non-alphabet characters like spaces and punctuation.

🧠 What is a Caesar Cipher? The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A → D

B → E

X → A

It’s a simple yet classic example of basic encryption techniques.

⚙️ How to Run the Program Clone the repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-python.git cd caesar-cipher-python Run the script:

bash Copy Edit python caesar_cipher.py Follow the instructions:

Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt (e or d)

Enter your message

Enter the shift value (e.g., 3)

💡 Example pgsql Copy Edit Type 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e Enter your message: Hello Prodigy Labs Enter shift value (e.g., 3): 4 Encrypted message: Lipps Tvsnmgc Pefw 🗂️ Files caesar_cipher.py – The main Python script
